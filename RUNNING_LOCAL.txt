Run the project locally

Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed (v12+ recommended)
- MongoDB running locally (default URL: mongodb://localhost:27017)

Steps:
1. Open a terminal and change to the project folder:
   cd "c:\Users\user\Utsav Folder\My Projects\webdevpactice\CampNepal"

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Ensure MongoDB is running locally. If you have the daemon available, you can run:
   mongod
   (or start the MongoDB service using your OS tools / MongoDB Desktop)

4. Seed the database (optional):
   If you want initial sample data, run the seeds script:
   node seeds/index.js

5. Start the app:
   node app.js

6. Open the app in your browser:
   http://localhost:3000

Optional development convenience:
- Install nodemon for automatic restarts during development:
  npm install -D nodemon
  npx nodemon app.js

Notes:
- The app connects to MongoDB at mongodb://localhost:27017/camp-nepal (hard-coded in `app.js`).
- Port: 3000 (set in `app.js`).
- If you want a start script, add to `package.json`:
   "scripts": {
      "start": "node app.js",
      "dev": "nodemon app.js"
   }

Technologies used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime used to run the server.
- Express: Web framework handling routes and middleware.
- EJS + ejs-mate: Templating engine and layout helper for views.
- MongoDB: Database (connected via mongodb://localhost:27017/camp-nepal).
- Mongoose: ODM used to model application data and communicate with MongoDB.
- Joi: Input validation for request bodies (`schemas.js`).
- method-override: Support for PUT/DELETE from HTML forms.
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS: Frontend templates and assets (in `views/`).
- npm: Package manager for installing dependencies and scripts.

Notes:
- The main app entry is `app.js` and the views live under the `views/` folder.
- Seed data lives in the `seeds/` folder and can be loaded with `node seeds/index.js`.
